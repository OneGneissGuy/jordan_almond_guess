## Jordan almond guessing contest analysis
### Backgroud
The [Law of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) (LLN) is an important underpinning of modern statistics. In general, the LLN states that given enough identical and independent measurements, the average measurement will tend towards the true value. One way to think about the LLN in practice is to consider the concept of the "wisdom of the crowd", which stipulates that a group of people will collectively come up with a better estimate of a quantity than a single person.  

#### We can test the law of large numbers by answering the questions: 

1) Will a crowd guess the correct almonds in a jar?

2) Will a crowd provide a closer guess on the number of almonds in a sealed jar than any single person?

We can perform this analysis and try to answer this question in pretty much any statistical package. Below is an example of one route using the python programming language in the form of a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).  The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text and promotes open science and data analysis.
